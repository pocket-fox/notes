= Standardization

When comparing values from disperate distributions, it is not useful to compare
them directly. Instead we must identify a shared property amongst them and base
our judgement on how each value relates to it. In statistics these properties
are called *measures of relative standing*. Distributions can be standardized
numerous ways and the method chosen will depend on the information known about
the distribution as well as the intended purpose of the standardization.
