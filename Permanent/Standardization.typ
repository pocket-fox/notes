= Standardization

When comparing values from disperate distributions, it is not useful to compare them directly. Instead we must identify a shared property amongst them and base our judgement on how each value relates to it. In statistics we call these properties *measures of relative standing*, and the measure used for standardization is the standardized value, or z-Score. A *samples* z-Score is a measure of how many standard deviations above or below the *mean* it is. So, a z-Score of 1.2 implies that the sample is 1.2 standard deviations above the mean of its distribution.

$
  z = (x - mu)/sigma
$

We can also standardize an entire distribution using the formula:

$
  Z = (X - mu)/sigma
$
