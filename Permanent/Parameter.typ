= Parameter

The constants assosciated with a particular distribution. Examples are the *mean* ($mu$), *standard
deviation* ($sigma$), and *variance* ($sigma^2$). Often the parameters of a distribution are what we
are trying to identify and thus are usually unknown. As a result we often use samples from
distributions of interest to construct *statistics* to use in place of their respective parameters.
