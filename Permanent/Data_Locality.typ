= Data Locality

The concept of data locality refers to how physically close in memory data is.
This is no unique to memory or storage; however, the concept is more relevant
when it comes to memory. This idea is the reaosn why arrays are prefered in
almost every algorithm in modern computing.

We simply have so much space in memory that the additional cost in memory of
storing everything in RAM is largely trivial.
