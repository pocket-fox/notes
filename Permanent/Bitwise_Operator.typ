= Bitwise Operator

In programming, bitwise operators are one category of the builtin functions. They operate directly on the bits stored at the *memory address* of their *operands*. They are faster to execute than all other *functions* and therefore can be key to *optimization*.

However, bitwise operators are often opaque and hard to intuit about, both when implementing as well as reading code.
