= Event

An event is simply a single instance of something occuring. In the context of statistics these are the most fundamental building blocks. A group of events define a *set*. Also known as a _member_, _item_, or _datapoint_.

Sets can also be seen as being events in and of themselves, denoting the occurance of any event within some greater group of events as itself an event. That is, treating "Did something in in this group occur? Yes / No" as an event itself.
