= Bullshit

Bullshit is the concept of lacking a concern for what is true. This is different
from *lying* in that there need not be a particular *narrative* attempting to be
spun nor must it be *intentional* or even *conscious*.

However, bullshit does have the impact of instilling, or at minimum encouraging,
a particular feeling in those that hear it. Additionally, bullshit tends to
obfuscate the responsibilty of the one employing it; it enables them to back out
with an "Oh, I didn't know..." or "I really did believe that at the time...".
These two characteristics serve to make bullshit frequently more insidious than
lying. It can have comparable impacts without the negative *conseuqnces*.

== Real Life

Trump may be the most quintessential example of bullshit, though politicians in
general serve as a good case study. Trump steeps himself in bullshit such that
he is never concerned with the state of reality. Being so absolutely unconcerned
with the facts of the matter enables him to say anything he wants, true or
false, to encourage the support of his cause without fear of the label "lair".
This is how he maintained support of the public through his claims that the 2020
election was fraudulent and the fallout thereof.
