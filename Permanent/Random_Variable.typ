= Random Variable

A random variable is *function* that maps items from the *sample space* to the
*real numbers*.
$
    SS -> RR
$
This mapping can be done in an arbitrary way. For example, you could assign a
value of $5$ to whenever a coin turns up heads and $-2$ to whenever a coin turns
up tails. The random variable is *NOT* the function that can tell you the final
total of some number of flips. The random variable can only tell you what the
value of a particular event is.
