= Energy
Daily Time Investment: $~ 30 "seconds" times "# of characters"$ Effort
Investment: Low

== Prerequisites
- additional character slots

== Information
Two available energy sinks:
1. energy pots
    - quick and easy
2. milk
    - more profit but takes ages
    - some milk is may be required by cooking recipies



= Farming
Special Plants:
- Daily Time Investment: $~ 20 "minutes"$
- Effort Investment: Low
Magical Plants:
- Daily Time Investment: $~ 5 "minutes"$
- Effort Investment: Low

== Prerequisites
- 0 to 100 CP depending on whether you use pearl fences and/or klaus fences
- klaus old moon fences //TODO: figure out where these come from
- pearl fences
- farming pearl outfit

== Information
The plant you choose to farm should contribute to your Imperial Cooking turn in.
Magical seeds will take less time to manage daily but will produce slightly less
yield both in terms of product and breeding byproducts. Breed your plants until
you have enough to have enough seeds to reseed your farms; gather the rest. Not
every farm slot will be necessary to produce all the ingredients needed for
Imperial turn ins; extra slots can be used for other purposes:
- cp generation (via breeding for leaves)
- raw silver
- etc?



= Imperial Turn In
Turn In:
- Daily Time Invenstment: $~ 5 "minutes"$
- Effort Investment: Low
Manual Gathering & Production:
- Daily Time Investment: $~ (1 "hour")/(2 "days")$
- Effort Investment: High

== Prerequisites
- cooking level
- cooking tool
- manos clothes
- manos tool
- pearl shop outfit
- T4 or T5 hedgehog
- alchemy level\*

\* alchemy is a lot of effort and as such can be reasonable disregarded as a
manual task

== Information
Before doing anything, you can check the value of imperial boxes on the Central
Market; any boxes that cost less than their turn in can be purchased directly
and turned in for "free" silver. *ONLY BUY & TURN IN GURU BOXES*. This will
likely be how you turn in alchemy Imperials forever because actually producing
alchemy boxes is alot of effort. Once you have decided on which Imperial box you
intend to manufacture yourself, identify which manually gathered resources you
will need, which manos tool(s) you will need to gather them, and where the best
place to gather those resources is. Gathering the main ingredient will need to
be done manually every so often (as much as you can handle). Vegetables can be
purchased from NPCs in cities and any remaining ingredients should ideally come
from your node network.



= Nodes
Daily Time Investment: $0 "minutes"$ Effort Investment: Medium - High (depending
on your micromanagement)

== Prerequisites
- node knowledge
- contribution points
- workers (skilled+)
- trading level

== Information
Your node network should be designed such that it contributes to your Imperial
turn ins. The first nodes you invest in should be the nodes that are: one, close
to cities so as to keep CP cost low, and two, high yield for resources that
contribute to your Imperial Recipies. After you have those nodes, the next nodes
should produce resources for trade crates. Pick some crates to produce; this
will involve processing the raw node materials down to their refined forms,
therefore this is where you need processsing levels. However, before turning
them in, you should check the central market. If the raw resources you chose for
your trading boxes are more valuable make sure to sell them directly to the
market. Any additional CP can be spent on nodes for other purposes:
- raw silver
- manufacture cooking utensils
- etc?



= Fishing
Daily Time Investment: $~ 15 "minutes"$ Effort Investment: little to none

== Prerequisites
- +10 balenos fishing rod (or)
    - pearl shop rod
- boat
- item brand for rod
- pearl outfit
- T4 or T5 pet griffon
- T4 or T5 pet otter
- fishtank from quest
- fishtank from pearl shop
- level 49 character with the above items

== Information
Fishing is AFK and is most effectively done in the bottom right of the map
between the islands. Each morning you need to travel from the fishing spot to
LoML (Seoul) and turn in the fish at the trade manager; make sure to play the
trading game for increased profits. Throw away everything below blue grade
(click the blue fish). Characters level 49 and below cannot be PvP killed and as
such are more safe for AFK fishing.
