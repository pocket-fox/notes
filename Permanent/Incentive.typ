= Incentive

An incentive is anything that causes someone to want to do something. They can be positive or negative in nature. A positive incentive might be that you will get payed more if you perform a task in a particular way, in this case the intent of the incentive would be to influence the method in which you accomplish the task. A negative incentive would be the criminal justice system. You are discouraged from committing crimes due to the possible reprecussions involved.

Incentives are not always clear however. All systems involving humans include incentives whether they are intentional or not. For example, if a sales firm tends to promote employees who have large numbers of sales, they are incentivizing their employees to make as many sales as possible.

The above example also demonstrates the insidious nature of some incentives. If the firm fails to account for it, they may fail to promote an employee who makes fewer sales but whos individual sales are more profitable.
