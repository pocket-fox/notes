= Obedience

Obedience is the concept of doing that which you are *communicated* to do. The
communication can be explicit or implicit as well as verbal or not. Many mammals
tend towards obedience, humans included. This is why trends emerge, whether they
be fashion, langauage, or conceptual.

The *evolutionary* basis for obedience is likely that it enables social
creatures to avoid conflict. This allows children to learn from their parents
before they must act on their own. This also allows more complex social
structures to emerge, structures which enable their participants to outperform
thier competition; examples being city states and governments, as well as trade.

On a smaller scale, obedience can enable an individual to see themselves as less
responsible for their actions if they were following orders from another. This
allows them to *transfer* their responsibilty in whole or in part onto another
or a group of others.

Examples of obedience gone wrong are the *Milgram Experiments* and the *Mylai
Massacre*.
