= Set

A set is some collection of members or *events*. This could include all members of the *sample space* or any subdivision thereof. The members of a set must be unique, that is to say they cannot contain repeated members.

The *empty set* ($emptyset$) is a unique set consisting of exactly no members.

A *super set* is simply a set of smaller *subsets*.

Sets have mathematical operations unique to them:
1. *Union*
2. *Intersection*
3. *Compliment*
4. *Cardinality*
5. *Negation*

Sets also have properties unique to them:
1. *Mutual Exclusivity*
2. (*In*)*Dependence*
