  The authority could even provide significant privacy assurances.  Thanks to advances in
  cryptography, the authority could block attempted double-spends without knowing the amounts or
  the parties involved.

Bitcoin itself does not implement these technologies, Monero does however. I dont understand how
these technologies work while still having functioning technology.

  the system as a whole would have a  single point of failure, the central ledger tracking all
  transactions. It would  resemble traditional digital money more than digital cash.
]

So far, no one has solved the 51% attack problem with any cryptocurrency. Until such time as this
problem is solved, there will always be a "single point of failure". This makes crypto rather
unreliable as there is no process for recompensation if an attack is successful.

  But banks usually don’t store funds in vaults, physical or otherwise. They lend our money to
  others for profit. So by enlisting a bank to store our funds, we must also trust them to do so
  responsibly. If they do it irresponsibly, we might lose some or all of our funds. 
]

This lending of the money that they store is not simply "something that they do"; this behavior is
fundamental to modern economies. Were we to transition to a cryptocurrency for our monetary system
we would still end up needing banking institutions so effectively distribute money for investments.

  But whether service providers manage funds, facilitate transactions, or both, they know quite a
  bit about us. We provide personal information when we sign up for their services. And as we use
  those services, they collect even more personal information. So we have to trust that they’ll
  steward this information responsibly – to protect it from prying eyes and to surrender it to 
  authorities only with due cause.

These crypto banks would end up needing to track identities to associate them with their account,
at which point we have simply reinstituted the current system. Even if the technology allowed us to
implement a bank that does't need to track identities for technical reasons, I think most banks
would wind up having to track identities so as to faccilitate communication with transaction
handlers for the purposes of preventing illicit use of their services.


#quote(attribution:[page 7])[
  It might also be true that we would benefit from having options without one or more of these
  trusted parties so that participating in the economy doesn’t force us into a single set of
  tradeofs.

Are there people arguing against the mere existence of cryptocurrencies? I think we're boxing
shadows here. Even if most people agreed that we should get rid of all cryptocurrencies, it would
be an impossible task. This is by design of the cryptocurrency. Even a single device with a copy
of the ledger is sufficient to spin up the entire system again as it was; and on top of that, any
attempts to totally destroy the ledger would fail to destroy the system itself as cryptocurrency
is nothing more than an algorithm, i.e. knowledge, as is impossible to destroy.

  Credit card companies, banks, and payment processors often block transactions and close accounts.
  Governments sometimes seize money from the accounts of citizens.
]

This will remain the case with any monetary system, people do not want to be making finacial
transactions with certain people. If we wanted to stop this behavior, we already can via
legislation. I agree that such a system would be less effective than an algorithmic sureity;
however, it seems to be the case that we DON'T want to implement such a law.


#quote(attribution:[page 10])[
  Bitcoin also does away with makers in an important sense. The Federal Reserve updates its
  projections and policies frequently. On a near-monthly basis, millions tune in for the
  pronouncements from a single man at a podium to guide spending and investment – monetary 
  groundhog day.

This is litterally the core benefit of the modern economy, we enable highly specialized
economists to control national monetary policy to the benefit of the global population. Maintaining
a stable economy enables greater levels of free trade, which then enables more effective
distribution of goods. The first person to develop the foolproof algorithm for managing inflation
and global economic stablitity is likely in line for a nobel peace prize and a place in history
more flattering than Einstein or Napolean.
