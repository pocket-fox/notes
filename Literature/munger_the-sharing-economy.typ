This is not always true, its isn't uncommon for people to want the feeling of owning something.

Almost everything we own will soon be a potential rental item, or we won’t own it all because we’ll
rent it from someone else. And (almost) everything will be better. Except for the things that will 
be worse.

It does not seem to be the case that "everything will be better" is true. In most cases it seems
as though the average quality of a service provided by one of these rental companies (Uber, Netflix,
and AirBnb) is significantly degraded. Perhaps the argument is that we have not yet reached the
necessary tipping point at which the quality will begin to exceed the average owners. However, I
find this unlikely. People tend, at least in my experience, to want their things to be the way they
want them, even down to the minute details. This seems like a rather significant hurtle to overcome
for non software items and services. Even then, Netflix has failed to increase the average quality
of their goods, and the media streaming industry has largely been on a downward slope in quality for
a while now. The only "rental" service I have come into contact with that has provided a "better"
version of the good on average is steam. Even then, they are only a "rental" service in the most
diabolical of interpretations. Yet, despite the convenience they provide, I would still opt to buy
my games from the original publishers given the oportunity.

After all, if I own an apartment, I’m already paying for utilities and making mortgage payments. But
what if I’m not always there or if I have an extra room I almost never use except for storing junk?
I would be willing—maybe even happy—to offer someone else my place to stay for whatever I can get to
pay toward my fixed costs and the cost of having to clean it afterward.

There seems to be a limit to this behavior though, and Munger provides the example himself. We seem
to have developed a system, in AirBnb that enables the reduction in transaction costs for precisely
this example. Yet, despite that, while you do see owners of property renting that property out, you
rarely if ever see the rentee further renting that property based on when they will and wont be
using it. Again, maybe the argument is that the transaction costs have not been reduced far enough to
enable this behavior. I simply think their is a fundamental bottom to this function, and we have
likely reached it in a number of fields already.
