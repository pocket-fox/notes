= The Emotional Dog

#quote(attribution:[page 2])[
  Julie and Mark are brother and sister. They are traveling together in France on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie was already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy making love, but they decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret, which makes them feel even closer to each other. What do you think about that, was it OK for them to make love?

The 'rational' models answer to this question is something to the tune of: _"There is almost always going to be a power dynamic in a familial relationship such that one partner is has a disproportionate amount of power and influence over the other"_. The reasoning used wouldn't look disimilair to that which is used to discourage relationships between a boss and their subordinate. In the case where this isn't the case I don't believe most people would have a moral issue with the relationship. For example, if we eliminate the power differential by supposing that the siblings were seperated at birth and knowledge of their familial relationship only comes to light well into their relationship, I don't believe a moral prolem arises so long as the pair don't attempt to have a biological child with each other. I believe this would be the stance of most people. As such it seems not to be the case that the 'incest' in and of itself is the moral wrong.

  Intuitionism in philosophy refers to the view that there are moral truths, and that when people grasp these truths they do so not by a process of ratiocination and reflection, but rather by a process more akin to perception, ...

It seems impossible that such a moral system would result in anything less than the complete destruction of all civilized society. Such a system eliminates any room for disagreement on morality. If you claim that "Well, obviously not, theres no way to know for sure that your correct so you would have to consider the possibility that you are wrong.", then you have simply arrived back at rationalism and possibly started a war along the way.

  Moral reasoning is usually an ex-post facto process used to influence the intuitions (and hence judgments) of other people.

While I do belive this to be true in the vast majority of cases, I think it is a manifestation of utilitarian laziness rather than a moral revelation. The human brain simply can't bring to bear all its faculties on every choice it has to make, it would take too much time. This is evidenced by how we think more highly of those who have put greater thought into their morals and thus the decisions they make.

  These findings offer four reasons for doubting the causality of reasoning in moral judgment: 1) there are two cognitive processes at work -- reasoning and intuition -- and the reasoning process has been overemphasized; 2) reasoning is often motivated; 3) the reasoning process constructs post-hoc justifications, yet we experience the illusion of objective reasoning; and 4) moral action covaries with moral emotion more than with moral reasoning.

The reasons provided are nothing more than observations. They provide no logic as to why one ought to doubt the *causality* of reasoning in our morals. That is a rather strong pitch.



#quote(attribution:[page 2])[
  the social intuitionist model is an anti-rationalist model only in one limited sense: it says that moral reasoning is rarely the direct cause of moral judgment. That is a descriptive claim, about how moral judgments are actually made. It is not a normative or prescriptive claim, about how moral judgments ought to be made.

Clearly I misunderstood the purpose of this paper... we aren't discussing the nature of reality nor how to be moral, simply observing human behavior and identifying information that can be useful to us in the endevours of predicting how humans will behave and manipulating them to act in particular ways. 

I think the papers presumption that morality itself has at least some fundamental part that is intuitive is flawed.

  ...unless we _care_ about those people, unless we have some _sentiment_ that values human life, reason alone cannot advise against taking the action.

Given that I am a rationalist as well as a naturalist, this is quite a strong assertion. Why do we assume that those feelings aren't the product of evolution, simply effective tools for staying alive and propogating ones DNA.


== Social Intuitioinist Model

=== Core

1. *Intuitive Judgement Link*: moral judgements are automatic and instantaneous.
2. *Post-hoc reasoning Link*: moral reasoning is effortful and engaged in after the moral judgement has been made. Additionally, it serves to reinforce the initial judgement, not supplant it.
3. *Reasoned Persuasion Link*: moral reasoning does not itself convince one to alter their judgement, rather the reasoning only serves to illicit countervailing intuitions sufficient to dislodge the original judgement.
4. *Social Persuasion Link*: the mere fact that others have a particular intuition exerts influence on ones own judgements

=== Private

5. *Reasoned Judgement Link*: it is possible that one can, through sheer force of logic, reason themselves to a particular judgement; however, this is exceedingly rare
6. *Private Reflection Link*: private reflection can illicit countervailing intuitions, serving to modify the initial judgement




There seems to be a disconnect between the 'rationalists' and the 'intuitionists'. The rationalists seem to be talking about how one comes to _trueist_ statements of morality whereas the 'intuitionsist' are talking about how humans behave. It seems to me that we are talking about two wholly unrelated topics here.

  The emerging view in social cognition is that most of our behaviors and judgments are in fact made automatically (i.e., without intention, effort, or awareness of process; Bargh, 1994; Bargh & Chartrand, 1999; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995).

Was this not the default position? This seems like it is obviously true upon only the most cursory evaluation of a persons actions or thoughts.

=== Classes of Motives

There exists two categories of motives which seem to direct and modify our moral reasoning:
*Related Motives*: desires for harmony and agreement cause us to tend toward reasoning that encourage such traits and discourage disharmony and conflict.
*Coherence Motives*: desires to maintain our current beliefs cause us to be more critical to information and reasoning that contradicts our already held morals


It seemed that IQ is strongly correlated with better moral behavior. It was theorized that this was due to the development of greater impulse control which develops alongside the same parts of the brain as those which contribute most significantly to IQ
- IQ is inversly correlated with negative morality, i.e. not committing crime
- IQ is *not* correlated with greater positive morality, i.e. giving to charity

This seemed to show that rather than IQ it was self-control that was the predictive trait
