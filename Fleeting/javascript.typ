= Javascript

- single threaded
- garbage collected
- and JIT-compiled
- ```js ==``` and ```js !=``` are not normal
    - they attempt to compare values across types, that is
        ```js (5 == "5") = true```
- ```js ===``` and ```js !==``` are the equivalent of normal ```c ==``` and
    ```c !=```
- supports fall through
