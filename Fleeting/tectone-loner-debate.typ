- attacked on 10/7
    - there is a greater history
        - blockades

- 10/7 has caused israel to have an "excuse" to view rhetoric as potential
    threats

- isreal is attempting to establish hegemonic control
    - via military action against some and allying w/ others

- movemenst toward a greater israel
    - subjagating surrounding nations?

- no real "imminent" threats in the area
    - yet continuing strikes

- israel wants destruction of current iranian regime

- hezbollah hadnt attacked israel since 10/7
    - doesnt lebanon have a right to a military?
    - hezbollah is a non 'western' conception of an arm of the government

- might makes right is just real politik
    - lebanon 'hezbol' was antagonized
    - hezbol is lebanons best bet against israel

- pager attacks killed civs

- helzbollah justification for 10/8 was reaction to israel striking gaza

- issues w/ aid distribution in gaza

- houthis claim to be helping gaza
    - no one is willing to stand up to israel
        - secifically militarily


- hezbol is justifying in its existance and its armaments

- it seems like only these paramilitary groups are willing to stand up against
    israel

- houthi method is bad because 'killing civs is bad'
    - but they cant beat israel in a direct war

- israel over the past couple decades walks like a colonialist expansionist
    power

- israel has gone 50x past a reasonable response
    - no longer 'defending israel'
    - so many more casualties
    - genocide is a fine term

- is removing israel a efficable goal
    - not a 'real' group... no roll call
    - dudes in tshirts

- israel is an intelegence superpower
    - had to know about 10/7

- defeating terrorism this way breeds trerrosrists

- ceasefire and distribution of aid
    - external force needs to launch a program to achieve this
    - work w/ hamas to get this done
    - nervous uncertain peace is better than status quo

- same can be said of israels behavior in gaza
    - the status quo is israel expansion

- whos to say new government wouldnt devolve into hamas 2.0
    - no better group to negotiate w/ than hamas

- afganistan
    - US had to set up sustainable government
    - taliban came right back to power

- israel blowing up so many civs with their strikes

- palestinian dissenters may not be capable of governing
    - due to perception of the new regime as fake

- international project

- israel wants to annex gaza
